# Pattern Matching Game
## Overview
This Pattern Matching Game challenges players to remember and replicate a sequence of colours that progressively gets longer and more complex with each level. 
Each round, a new colour is added to the sequence, and the player must reproduce the sequence by clicking the coloured buttons in the correct order. 
The game tests memory and concentration skills and provides a fun and engaging way to exercise your brain.

## Features
- Dynamic Difficulty: The game becomes progressively more challenging as you successfully complete levels.
- Colourful Interface: A visually appealing interface with four distinct colours.
- Sound Effects: Auditory feedback for each colour in the sequence, correct sequences, and incorrect attempts.
- Game Over and Restart: When a player fails to replicate the sequence, the game ends, displaying the achieved level and offering a chance to restart.

Advance Through Levels: Each time you correctly replicate a sequence, you advance to the next level, where an additional colour is added to the sequence.
Game Over: If you replicate the sequence incorrectly, the game ends. The game will display your final score (level reached) and instructions to restart.
